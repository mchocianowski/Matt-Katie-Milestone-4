### *The font:*

With the site being focused to showcase photography, the lato font at weight 300 from google fonts has been chosen to allow the viewers to be able to read quickly and efficiently. Using such a sleek and simple font means that there is no attention taken away from the imagery. Along with the colours being used are very simple with just a black and white colour pallet so that the colours on the photographs are what the viewer notices first. The weight 300 provides a sleek look to the site, smaller weights were too thin and hard to read where in contrast greater font weight was too bulky and took away from the websites sleek design.

### *The imagery:*

The sites imagery only consists of the photographs that have been taken by the photographer. By doing this we don’t allow for any confusion as to what is owned by the siteadmin and therefore the photographers. There has been a decision to avoid background images so that it isn’t taking away from the foreground images again to avoid confusion or negative contrast between colours.

### *The colour scheme:*

The colour scheme for this site is monotone, since the main purpose of the site is to show off the photography, avoiding any 
vibrant colours has allowed the site to showcase it's purpose. Rather than adding lots of colours to the site the presentation has been worked on through adding things such as horizontal rules and card elements to diiferentiate site sections. Again the card elements are set to a pale grey in order to provide slight contrast from the background of the site to grab the users attention and distinguish themselves. This allows for a shadow effect behind the main object which is the imagery.
